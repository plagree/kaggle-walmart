Ideas for Walmart competition
=============================


Split in different cases:
- shop type (A, B, C, ...)
- holiday week
- possibly weeks around holiday week

Features to consider (non holiday week):
- parameters of the week
- last week (or week before holiday week)
- last year week corresponding to the same week

Features holiday week:
- same so far


What to do with EMPTY values?
- linear interpolation with previous non-empty/next non-empty week
