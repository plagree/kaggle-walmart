TO IMPROVE

1. Training dataset construction with both last week and last year  /// DONE
2. Testing dataset construction to avoid "FUCK"s /// not yet perfect
3. Type "C" issue??
4. Regression method employed - test others

POSSIBILITY

a. Use a serie (last computed value from test dataset use for next previous week)
b. Only fit the function with previous year stuff
c. NaN values not replaced by mean but mean for Dept and Store :)
